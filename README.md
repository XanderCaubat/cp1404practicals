# CP1404 Practicals

This is my main repository of cp1404 programing based on 
[weekly practicals](https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals) 
provided by Lindsay Ward.

## About Me

I'm a 2nd year TechInno student that is studying the field
of Information Technology that has a previous experience in
hospitality industry.

These collection of programs that I have practiced on help 
me as a student especially with little to no back-end 
I.T. experience. So if you see any of my pull request feel 
free to give your insight as this will help me in improving
my skills :).

## Clean Coding

During my study period for cp1404, I have learned more ways 
of clean coding in contrast to my first programing subject.

I have learned 3 main lessons that I think is important to 
this subject, which are:

- Reading and practicing standard [programming patterns](https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns).
- Appropriate naming for variables, CONSTANTS and dictionaries.
- And, keeping in mind SRP rule regarding functions.
